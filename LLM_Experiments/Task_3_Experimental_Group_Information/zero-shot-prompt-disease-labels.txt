Determine what types of subjects are used in the experiment described in the text block below. The following information should be determined for each subject group:

1. The specific name given in the text for the subject group, if so provided (otherwise report "", the empty string);
2. A short free-text description of the subject group, derived from the provided text block;
3. The number of subjects in each group (expressed as an integer), this should take into account any subjects dropped for any reason;
4. You MUST pick the SINGLE closest match for the subject group's description from this alphabetical list of 'cv_term':

You MUST choose exactly ONE (1) of the cv_term from the list above. No more, no less. Do NOT invent or create a new term that is not explicitly on this list. Please pay special attention to this requirement, my job depends on it.

Use the JSON prototype below to format your reply, but there may be more (or fewer) than 2 groups which can be added (or removed) as appropriate to this example:

JSON = """
{
  "SubjectGroups": [
    {
        "name_given": "",
        "description": "",
        "number":,
        "cv_term": ""
    },
    {
        "name_given": "",
        "description": "",
        "number":,
        "cv_term": "" 
    }
  ]
}

The text block to be analyzed follows the delimiter:
