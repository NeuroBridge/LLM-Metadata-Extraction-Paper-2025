Following the '###' delimiter below is the text of a scientific research paper from the field of psychiatry. This paper may, or may not, collect a structural brain image (often called a T1 image) as part of the study reported.

If there is a structural MRI collected, please report the following parameters, ONLY if they are present:

+ T, the strength of the scanner, in units of Tesla
+ TR, the "repetition time" in units of milliseconds
+ TE, the "echo time" in units of milliseconds
+ TI, the "inversion time" in units of milliseconds
+ flip_angle, the "flip angle", in units of degrees
+ FOV, the "field of view" this can be 1, 2, or 3 numbers, each in millimeters
+ voxel_size, the size of each voxel in millimeters; this can be given as 1, 2, or 3 numbers which you should report as a list of the numbers
+ matrix_size, the size of the matrix, unitless, usually given as 2 or 3 numbers which you should report as a list of numbers
+ slice_thickness, the thickness of the slices in millimeters
+ acquisition_time, in units of seconds; IMPORTANT if given as minutes, please convert the minutes and seconds to seconds!
+ number_of_slices, self-explanatory, this is the number of slices collected in the scan
+ image_orientation, from the list: axial, sagittal, and coronal. (Axial is sometimes called "transverse" but always list either "transverse" or "axial" as "axial" in the JSON)

You should only report the parameters that are EXPLICITLY LISTED in the text of the paper. Do NOT attempt to determine any parameters that are not EXPLICITLY listed!

Your response should follow the following JSON prototype:
