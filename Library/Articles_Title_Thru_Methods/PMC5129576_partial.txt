Dissociable relations between amygdala subregional networks and psychopathy trait dimensions in conduct‐disordered juvenile offenders.

Abstract.
Psychopathy is a serious psychiatric phenomenon characterized by a pathological constellation of affective (e.g., callous, unemotional), interpersonal (e.g., manipulative, egocentric), and behavioral (e.g., impulsive, irresponsible) personality traits. Though amygdala subregional defects are suggested in psychopathy, the functionality and connectivity of different amygdala subnuclei is typically disregarded in neurocircuit‐level analyses of psychopathic personality. Hence, little is known of how amygdala subregional networks may contribute to psychopathy and its underlying trait assemblies in severely antisocial people. We addressed this important issue by uniquely examining the intrinsic functional connectivity of basolateral (BLA) and centromedial (CMA) amygdala networks in relation to affective, interpersonal, and behavioral traits of psychopathy, in conduct‐disordered juveniles with a history of serious delinquency (N = 50, mean age = 16.83 ± 1.32). As predicted, amygdalar connectivity profiles exhibited dissociable relations with different traits of psychopathy. Interpersonal psychopathic traits not only related to increased connectivity of BLA and CMA with a corticostriatal network formation accommodating reward processing, but also predicted stronger CMA connectivity with a network of cortical midline structures supporting sociocognitive processes. In contrast, affective psychopathic traits related to diminished CMA connectivity with a frontolimbic network serving salience processing and affective responding. Finally, behavioral psychopathic traits related to heightened BLA connectivity with a frontoparietal cluster implicated in regulatory executive functioning. We suggest that these trait‐specific shifts in amygdalar connectivity could be particularly relevant to the psychopathic phenotype, as they may fuel a self‐centered, emotionally cold, and behaviorally disinhibited profile.

INTRODUCTION.
Psychopathy is characterized by a pathological constellation of affective (e.g., callous, unemotional), interpersonal (e.g., manipulative, egocentric), and behavioral (e.g., impulsive, irresponsible) personality traits [Andershed et al., 2007; Cooke and Michie, 2001; Neumann et al., 2006]. The developmental trajectory of psychopathy seemingly begins early in life and includes the presence of nascent psychopathic traits in conduct‐disordered juveniles [Anderson and Kiehl, 2014; Colins et al., 2014; Frick and Viding, 2009; Lynam et al., 2007]. These youngsters with psychopathic tendencies showcase a disproportionate amount of violent and antisocial acts, respond less favorably to treatment, and as such place a substantial economic and emotional burden on society [Anderson and Kiehl, 2014; Corrado et al., 2015; Frick and Viding, 2009; Salekin et al., 2010]. Yet, despite these pressing concerns the pathophysiology of psychopathic traits in these youths remains poorly understood. As psychopathy is increasingly conceptualized a disorder of neurocircuits [Anderson and Kiehl, 2012; Blair, 2015], adopting a brain connectivity approach seems crucial in elucidating the underlying neuropathology and informing more effective treatment strategies.
Recent system‐level theories suggest amygdala‐centered network dysfunction in the etiology of psychopathic traits among antisocial people [Anderson and Kiehl, 2012; Blair, 2015; Blair, 2013a]. Within these theories, the amygdala is generally hyporesponsive to negative affective stimuli and lacks optimal functional interactions with paralimbic neurocircuits, leading to deficient affective reactivity (particularly to fear), biased attention modulation, and poor associative learning [Anderson and Kiehl, 2012; Blair, 2013a; Blair, 2015]. Very few studies, though, have actually investigated amygdala functional networks in relation to psychopathy, yielding conflicting results of both enhanced and diminished network integrity [Aghajani et al., 2016; Contreras‐Rodriguez et al., 2015; Decety et al., 2013a; Finger et al., 2012; Marsh et al., 2011; Motzkin et al., 2011; Yoder et al., 2015]. Most of these studies additionally examined psychopathy as a categorical or unidimensional construct, overlooking its behaviorally and neuronally separable trait assemblies [Carre et al., 2013; Cohn et al., 2014, 2015; Philippi et al., 2015; Sadeh and Verona, 2008; Seara‐Cardoso and Viding, 2014]. For instance, while affective and interpersonal traits of psychopathy relate to blunted affective reactivity within emotion processing neurocircuitries (e.g., insula, amygdala, striatum), the opposite seems to account for behavioral psychopathic tendencies [Blair, 2013a; Buckholtz et al., 2010; Carre et al., 2013; Cohn et al., 2014, 2015b2014; Seara‐Cardoso and Viding, 2014]. Moreover, though amygdala subregional defects are suggested in psychopathy [Moul et al., 2012], the functionality and connectivity of different amygdala subnuclei is typically disregarded in neurocircuit‐level analyses of psychopathic personality. Hence, little is known of how amygdala subregional networks may contribute to psychopathy and its underlying trait assemblies in severely antisocial people. This is of particular concern, as complex psychiatric phenomena like psychopathy are growingly conceptualized a constellation of co‐occurring neurocircuit‐based dimensional entities [Blair, 2015; Cohn et al., 2015; Morris and Cuthbert, 2012; Philippi et al., 2015]. Knowledge on how major amygdalar circuits may associate to different traits of psychopathy could thus provide crucial insights into the underlying neuropathology, possibly informing the development of reliable biomarkers and more effective treatment strategies.
The amygdala comprises multiple structurally and functionally distinct subnuclei, commonly grouped into the basolateral (BLA) and centromedial (CMA) amygdala complexes [LeDoux, 2007]. The BLA receives information from multiple brain systems and is a site of integration with cortical territories, including those that regulate socioemotional functions [Bzdok et al., 2013; Ghashghaei and Barbas, 2002; LeDoux, 2007; Pessoa, 2011; Sah et al., 2003]. It contributes greatly to the perception, evaluation, and memory formation of emotionally salient events [Davis and Whalen, 2001; LeDoux, 2007; Moul et al., 2012]. The CMA, in contrast, is less heavily integrated with cortical circuits, though its thalamic and insular connections do allow for cortical crosstalks that seemingly shape early information processing [Bienkowski and Rinaman, 2013; Bzdok et al., 2013; Ghashghaei and Barbas, 2002; Keifer et al., 2015; Pessoa, 2011; Sah et al., 2003]. It is the primary output site of the amygdala, and orchestrates behavioral and physiological aspects of emotion processing and associative learning via its projections to the brainstem, cerebellum, and hypothalamus [Davis and Whalen, 2001; LeDoux, 2007; Moul et al., 2012]. Noteworthy, recent theories ascribe some of the cognitive and affective deficits in psychopathy to chronic BLA hypoactivity and exaggerated CMA function, which may speculatively be reflected in BLA and CMA functional connectivity [Moul et al., 2012]. Yet, despite these speculations, little is known of how these subregional connectivity profiles may actually contribute to the neuropathology underlying different traits of psychopathy.
One particularly powerful method for examining BLA and CMA functional connectivity is intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) analysis, which delineates the functional architecture of intrinsically (i.e., spontaneously) coupled brain networks [Fox and Raichle, 2007]. These intrinsic brain networks are relatively stable across participants and time [Smith et al., 2009], correspond spatially with well‐known functional networks [Smith et al., 2009], and can signal abnormal brain function and psychopathology [Greicius, 2008]. Employing iFC analysis, dissociable BLA and CMA connectivity profiles were recently documented in healthy adults and adolescents [Gabard‐Durnam et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2012; Roy et al., 2009], consistent with animal models of amygdaloid circuitry [Ghashghaei and Barbas, 2002; Keifer et al., 2015; LeDoux, 2007; Pessoa, 2011; Sah et al., 2003]. Further echoing earlier animal work, these iFC profiles were shown to undergo extensive age‐dependent changes, with BLA and CMA connectivity becoming increasingly segregated and specialized during the transition from adolescence to adulthood [Qin et al., 2012]. Importantly, and pertinent to the current study, these subregional iFC profiles seem relatively disorganized in psychiatric patients with emotion regulation deficits, suggesting impairments in various amygdala‐mediated functions [Aghajani et al., 2016; Etkin et al., 2009; Roy et al., 2013]. Despite the reputed amygdala dysfunction in psychopathy, though, little is known of how distinct traits of psychopathy might map onto BLA and CMA intrinsic connectivity, in people with clinical antisociality. In fact, only two studies have thus far assessed BLA and CMA connectivity in relation to underlying traits of psychopathy, and they either focused exclusively on its affective trait assembly or included only healthy participants who lacked clinical antisociality [Aghajani et al., 2016; Yoder et al., 2015]. For instance, while iFC of BLA and CMA subregions with the paralimbic system seemed disorganized in antisocial youth with affective traits of psychopathy [Aghajani et al., 2016], potential contributions of interpersonal and behavioral trait assemblies were not directly investigated. This could be potentially relevant, as psychopathy is growingly conceptualized a pathological constellation of co‐occurring traits with discrete neurobehavioral correlates [Blair, 2015; Cohn et al., 2015; Philippi et al., 2015; Seara‐Cardoso and Viding, 2014]. Following this perspective, Yoder et al. [2015] recently revealed unique trait‐specific connectivity patterns between amygdala subregions and cortical and subcortical circuits. Specifically, while increased task‐based coupling of both BLA and CMA with paralimbic systems related to the interpersonal traits of psychopathy, its behavioral and affective traits, respectively, associated with decreased BLA and CMA coupling with regulatory frontal territories [Yoder et al., 2015]. This was, however, in a healthy non‐forensic group of adults without marked antisocial behaviors, and the authors utilized a task‐based effective connectivity approach rather than iFC analysis. Hence, little is known of how the underlying traits of psychopathy might differentially map onto BLA and CMA intrinsic connectivity, in people with marked antisociality.
We addressed this important issue by uniquely examining whether iFC of BLA and CMA networks differentially relate to affective, interpersonal, and behavioral traits of psychopathy, in a sample of conduct‐disordered juveniles with a history of serious delinquency. Echoing earlier work on amygdala subregional networks and their dissociable relations with psychopathy trait dimensions [Yoder et al., 2015], we hypothesized that both BLA and CMA connectivity would relate to the interpersonal dimension of psychopathy, while its affective dimension would relate primarily to CMA and its behavioral dimension primarily to BLA connectivity. Specifically, as interpersonal traits index a self‐centered, manipulative, and reward‐oriented interaction style [Andershed et al., 2007; Cooke and Michie, 2001; Neumann et al., 2006; Seara‐Cardoso and Viding, 2014], we speculated that these traits would relate to BLA and CMA connectivity with regions supporting sociocognitive [Andrews‐Hanna et al., 2010; Li et al., 2014] and reward‐related [Haber, 2011; Naqvi and Bechara, 2009] processes. In contrast, as affective psychopathic traits index callousness and lack of negative emotionality [Andershed et al., 2007; Cooke and Michie, 2001; Neumann et al., 2006; Seara‐Cardoso and Viding, 2014], it may seem reasonable to assume an association between these traits and connectivity of CMA with regions serving affective saliency and emotional responding [Etkin et al., 2011; Pessoa, 2011; Seeley et al., 2007]. Finally, as behavioral psychopathic traits index an impulsive, irresponsible, and disinhibited profile [Andershed et al., 2007; Cooke and Michie, 2001; Neumann et al., 2006; Seara‐Cardoso and Viding, 2014], one may speculate an association between these traits and connectivity of BLA with regions governing self‐regulation and action planning [Arnsten and Rubia, 2012; Menon, 2011; Seeley et al., 2007]. Considering the developmental variation in amygdala subregional connectivity [Qin et al., 2012], exploratory analysis additionally probed whether these trait‐specific iFC patterns might be impacted by age. This could be of importance, as interactions between psychopathology and age/maturation have in some cases been shown to impact amygdaloid function and structure [Tottenham and Sheridan, 2009; Weems et al., 2013, 2015].
MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Participants.
Fifty severely antisocial male juvenile offenders with a DSM‐IV diagnosis of conduct disorder (CD) (mean age = 16.83, SD = 1.32) were included in the present study. All participants were aged 15 to 19 years old and were medication‐naïve. Juvenile offenders with CD were recruited from a juvenile detention center and a forensic psychiatric facility, and had all been convicted for crimes such as assault, murder, and armed robbery. More details regarding participant inclusion are provided in the Supporting Information.
Clinical Assessment.
For all juvenile offenders, DSM‐IV diagnoses of CD were confirmed using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K‐SADS‐PL) [Kaufman et al., 1997], a widely used semi‐structured diagnostic interview. All juvenile offenders had to fulfill criteria for CD with at least one aggressive symptom (e.g., used a weapon, has been physically cruel to people, has stolen while confronting a victim). Consonant with recent neurobiological work on juvenile psychopathy [Cohn et al., 2014, 2015; Fairchild et al., 2013; Marsh et al., 2008; Pape et al., 2015], the Youth Psychopathic Traits Inventory (YPI) [Andershed et al., 2002] was used to assess psychopathic traits in conduct‐disordered juvenile offenders. The YPI is a widely used instrument composed of 50 self‐report items that assess adult psychopathy‐like personality traits in juveniles, with adequate validity and reliability [Neumann and Pardini, 2014; Pihet et al., 2014; Poythress et al., 2006]. Its items collectively probe the widely accepted 3‐factor model of psychopathy, which asserts deviations in affective, interpersonal, and behavioral personality domains (i.e., trait dimensions) [Andershed et al., 2007; Cooke and Michie, 2001; Jones et al., 2006; Neumann et al., 2006; Perez et al., 2015; Skeem et al., 2003]. Its affective dimension comprises callousness, unemotionality, and remorselessness; its interpersonal dimension includes dishonest charm, egocentric grandiosity, lying, and manipulation; while its behavioral dimension features impulsiveness, thrill seeking, and irresponsibility. In line with previous work [Andershed et al., 2007; Cohn et al., 2014, 2015], the three trait dimensions were correlated in the current study (r = 0.61‐0.75; all P < 0.01). Additional measures were also used to further assess the severity of antisocial tendencies, as well as externalizing and internalizing symptomatology. These included the Youth Self‐Report (YSR) [Achenbach, 1991], Basic Empathy Scale (BES) [Jolliffe and Farrington, 2006], and Reactive‐Proactive Aggression Questionnaire (RPQ) [Raine et al., 2006]. More detailed description of these measures is provided in the Supporting Information.
Data Acquisition and Preprocessing.
Resting‐state (RS) fMRI data were collected using a Philips 3T Achieva MRI scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands) with a 32‐channel SENSE (Sensitivity Encoding) head coil. Prior to scanning, all participants were accustomed to the scanning situation by lying in a dummy scanner and hearing scanner sounds. During the 7.5‐minute RS scan, participants were instructed to lie still with their eyes open while fixating on a white cross‐hair against a black background. Head motion was limited using padding and restraint. A total of 200 T2*‐weighted gradient‐echo echo‐planar imaging (EPI) volumes were acquired, using the following scan parameters: repetition time (TR) = 2200 ms, echo time (TE) = 30 ms, flip angle = 80°, 38 transverse slices with an in‐plane voxel resolution of 2.75x2.75 mm, 2.75 mm slice thickness, field of view (FOV) = 220x220 mm. For anatomical reference, a T1‐weighted anatomical scan was acquired for each participant with the following scan parameters: TR = 9.8 ms, TE = 4.6 ms, 140 sagittal slices with an isotropic voxel resolution of 0.88x0.87x1.2 mm, and FOV = 224x177 mm.
All data were preprocessed and analyzed using FSL version 5.0.7 (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/). Preprocessing consisted of nonbrain‐tissue removal, motion correction, grand mean‐based intensity normalization of the entire 4‐D data set by a single scaling factor, slice timing correction, spatial smoothing with a 6 mm full width at half maximum Gaussian kernel, and temporal bandpass filtering at 0.009 < f < 0.15 Hz, which improves BOLD signal estimation and produces connectivity patterns that relate most closely to task‐based activations [Aghajani et al., 2016; Fox and Raichle, 2007; Fransson, 2006; Roy et al., 2009; Toro et al., 2008]. Finally, the RS data were registered to T1‐weighted anatomical images, and subsequently to the 2‐mm Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standard space image [Aghajani et al., 2016; Aghajani et al., 2016; Roy et al., 2013]. The maximum allowable mean displacement due to excessive head motion was set at 3 mm translation or 3º rotation in any direction. Additionally, to guard against the effects of in‐scanner micro‐motion on connectivity patterns we implemented motion‐censoring, also known as “scrubbing” [Power et al., 2012; Satterthwaite et al., 2013] (see Supporting Information for details).
Functional Connectivity Analysis.
Given apparent lateralization effects in amygdalar functionality and subregional connectivity [Aghajani et al. 2016, 2016; Baas et al., 2004; Brown et al., 2014; Gabard‐Durnam et al., 2014; Qin et al., 2014; Sergerie et al., 2008; Styliadis et al., 2014], and in line with recent work [Aghajani et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2012, 2014], BLA and CMA region of interest (ROI) masks were created in each hemisphere (see Supporting Information), and used to extract individual participant's mean time series within BLA and CMA complexes. Seed‐based whole‐brain iFC analysis implemented within FSL FEAT [Jenkinson et al., 2012], was then employed to reveal BLA and CMA connectivity patterns [Fox and Raichle, 2007]. Specifically, for each participant, and in each hemisphere, a general linear model (GLM) was created that included individual participant's mean time series of BLA and CMA complexes as predictors [Aghajani et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2014; Roy et al., 2013]. Temporally filtered signal from the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (see Supporting Information for details), as well as six motion parameters and parameters obtained from the motion censoring procedure (see Supporting Information for details), were also included in this model as covariates of no interest to correct for physiological and motion‐related variance [Aghajani et al., 2016]. This resulted in individual subject–level connectivity maps comprising voxels throughout the brain that exhibited iFC (i.e., temporal partial correlations) with each amygdala subregion, accounting for the relationships with the other subregion (i.e., unique subregion‐specific connectivity maps) [Aghajani et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2014; Roy et al., 2013]. Subject‐level iFC maps of BLA and CMA subregions were then fed into a group‐level mixed‐effects GLM analysis implemented in FEAT (with FLAME and automatic outlier de‐weighting), in order to average these subject‐level maps and create group‐level connectivity maps of BLA and CMA complexes [Aghajani et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2014; Roy et al., 2013]. Individual participant's affective, interpersonal, and behavioral trait scorings were simultaneously entered in this group‐level GLM analysis as predictors (with age and IQ as covariates), in order to reveal how individual variations in psychopathic traits relate to iFC profiles of BLA and CMA subregions. Entering all three trait dimensions in the same group‐level GLM takes into account their possible shared variance, thus revealing BLA and CMA connectivity patterns uniquely associated with each of the three trait dimensions. That is, trait‐specific variance in amygdalar iFC over and above what can be explained by the other traits. Following earlier work on amygdala subregional iFC patterns [Aghajani et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2014; Roy et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2015], the resulting statistical maps were all corrected for multiple comparisons using cluster‐based correction with initial cluster forming threshold of Z > 2.3 and cluster extent threshold of P < 0.05, which tends to adequately balance the propagation of false positives and false negatives [Bennett et al., 2009; Jenkinson et al., 2012; Lieberman and Cunningham, 2009].
