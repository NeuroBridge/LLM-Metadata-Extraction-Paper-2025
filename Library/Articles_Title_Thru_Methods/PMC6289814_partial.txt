Title.
Aberrant structural-functional coupling in adult cannabis users.
Abstract.
Cellular studies indicate that endocannabinoid type-1 retrograde signaling plays a major role in synaptic plasticity. Disruption of these processes by delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) could produce alterations either in structural and functional brain connectivity or in their association in cannabis (CB) users. Graph theoretic structural and functional networks were generated with diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional imaging in 37 current CB users and 31 healthy non-users. The primary outcome measures were coupling between structural and functional connectivity, global network characteristics, association between the coupling and network properties, and measures of rich-club organization. Structural-functional coupling was globally preserved showing a positive association in current CB users. However, the users had disrupted associations between structural-functional coupling and network topological characteristics, most perturbed for shorter connections implying region-specific disruption by CB use. Rich-club analysis revealed impaired structural-functional coupling in the hippocampus and caudate of users. This study provides evidence of the abnormal structural-functional association in CB users. The effect was predominant in shorter connections of the brain network, suggesting that the impact of CB use or predispositional factors may be most apparent in local interconnections. Notably, the hippocampus and caudate specifically showed aberrant structural and functional coupling. These structures have high CB1 receptor density and may also be associated with changes in learning and habit formation that occur with chronic cannabis use.
INTRODUCTION.
Rates of cannabis (CB) use have rapidly escalated in the United States over the past decade. A recent national survey indicated that 22.2 million persons were current users of marijuana, corresponding to 8.3% of the population 12 years of age or older. The primary psychoactive component of CB is Δ9–tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) known as a low-efficacy agonist for the endocannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors. CB1 receptors are widely distributed in the brain, particularly in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, neocortical regions and hippocampus. Since the endocannabinoid system mediates various forms of synaptic plasticity, THC likely interferes with these processes. In hippocampal culture of rat neurons, for example, THC can inhibit induction of new synapse formation. THC exposure in adolescent rats results in disruption of endocannabinoid signaling, normal maturation of the glutamatergic system and synaptic pruning. THC treatment in adolescent rats also results in lower dendritic length and numbers in the hippocampus coupled with impaired radial maze performance. These findings are consistent with a pivotal role for the endocannabinoid system in the development of neural connectivity and function. Consequently, there is a pressing need to clarify how cannabinoids affect brain connectivity in humans and whether these changes account for specific harms or possible benefits of CB use.
Functional neuroimaging studies, which examine correlations in activity between brain regions, suggest that acute THC administration alters resting-state functional connectivity (FC). Chronic CB users exhibited altered functional recruitment of the prefrontal cortex, inhibitory control networks (mean age = 23.7 years) and regions spanning the cerebellum to the prefrontal cortex (mean age = 19.3 year). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides a way to map network organization using white matter (WM) tractography to examine structural connectivity (SC) between gray matter regions. The integration of SC with FC allows the characterization of functional dynamics of the brain in terms of spatial topology. This approach, termed structural-functional (SC-FC) coupling, is defined by the association between FC and SC allowing more sensitive detection of subtle brain alterations than any single imaging modality. Importantly, the structural network constrains the functional network to regions with direct connections. It therefore would be well suited to test how observed cellular alterations in synaptic connectivity and signaling impact the functional organization of the brain in human CB users. While SC-FC coupling has not yet been assessed in CB users, this approach has shown alterations in other neuropsychiatric disorders. For example, SC-FC coupling disturbances have recently been reported in schizophrenia, a neuropsychiatric disorder for which CB use is a risk factor.
In this study, we tested whether the association of the structure-function network was affected in current CB users. We anticipated that the association (i.e., coupling) between SC and FC of CB users would be “globally” preserved, i.e., the intact positive coupling in the whole brain connectivity, which is also known to be dependent on the connection distance. Structural neuroimaging abnormalities in adult CB users have been most consistent for regions high in CB receptors. Thus, we expected that alterations of SC-FC coupling would be found in these “local” regions rich in CB1 receptors, associated with regionally-specific topological changes of connectivity. In addition, the importance of “Rich Club” (RC) connections with regard to SC-FC coupling has been previously demonstrated. Rich-club nodes of a network have been defined as the nodes that are not only much more connected but also highly linked among themselves. Since the regions of higher CB1 receptor density overlap with central hub regions in the brain network identified by RC, we also hypothesized that RC regions with higher CB1 receptor density would exhibit alterations of SC-FC coupling in CB users.
MATERIALS AND METHODS.
Participants.
Participants were recruited from the Indiana University campus and the surrounding community through flyers and advertisements in local publications. Subjects who passed an initial phone screen they were invited into the laboratory for assessment. Subjects first provided verbal and written informed consent, after which demographic, cognitive, questionnaire, substance use information and a diagnostic interview were obtained. All subjects were required to be 18 years of age or older, and free of any neurological disorder, head trauma with loss of consciousness greater than ten minutes, learning disability, and contraindication to MRI. Subject demographic information is provided in Table 1. The research protocol was approved by Indiana University’s Institutional Review Board for the protection of human subjects.
Thirty-one healthy control subjects without psychiatric disorders were recruited. Exclusion criteria included absence of an Axis I disorder, a history of substance abuse or dependence, a positive urine screen for CB or other substances, use of CB in the past three months and more than 12 lifetime exposures to CB (mean lifetime exposures = 0.8). All control participants were interviewed using the SCID-NP (non-patient version) to exclude individuals with psychiatric diagnoses. Thirty-seven current CB users were recruited who were recently using CB at least once per week, with mean monthly exposure of 32.6 and lifetime exposures > 45. All users were free from the current Axis I disorders and any other illicit substance abuse or dependence other than CB use disorders. Psychiatric diagnoses were ascertained with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID-I) Research Version. A written drug use questionnaire and a six-month time line follow back assessment was used to estimate recent and past use of CB. Three variables characterizing use of CB were chosen for statistical analyses: age of onset of first CB use, lifetime number of exposures to CB, and number of exposures to CB in the past month. Both age of onset and total lifetime exposures have been associated with risk for subsequent psychotic disorders, and thus represent potential predictors of brain network changes linked with vulnerability to psychosis. CB use in the past month assessed possible effects of CB metabolites on brain connectivity. The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) was administered to estimate currently intellectual function. Groups did not significantly differ in age, IQ, alcohol use, gender or race (p > 0.05); however, the CB group had fewer years of education (14.0 vs. 15.4 years; Table 1). Subjects were asked to refrain from alcohol or CB use prior to the MRI scan. At screening, 11 subjects (including 1 control subject) identified themselves as a smoker on the Fagerstrom Nicotine Dependence Questionnaire, of which only 3 subjects (without controls) scored above a zero (two scored a 1 and one scored a 2), which is indicative of “very low dependence”. At the time of MRI scan, nine subjects self-reported nicotine use within the past 7 days.
MRI Acquisition.
Image acquisition was performed on a 3T Siemens Tim-Trio MRI scanner. Foam pads were used to minimize head motion for all participants. Functional scans were acquired using a single-shot echo-planar-imaging (SS-EPI) sequence [repetition time (TR) = 813 ms; echo time (TE) = 28 ms; flip angle = 60°; 42 transverse slices; slice thickness 3.4 mm; field of view (FOV) = 220×220 mm2; imaging matrix = 64×64; in-plane voxel size = 3.44×3.44 mm2]. Subjects were instructed to rest in the scanner looking at a fixation-cross on a screen via an LCD projector. Scans for the first 10 sec were discarded to allow the T1-magnetisation equilibrium, resulting in a total of 1000 volumes (= 14 min). DTI scans were obtained (= 6 min 24 sec) using SS-EPI sequence [TR = 4.5 s; TE = 88 ms; flip angle = 90°; 72 transverse slices; slice thickness 2 mm; FOV = 256×256 mm2; imaging matrix = 128×128; in-plane voxel size = 2×2 mm2; 64 non-collinear directions; b-value of 1,000 s/mm2; 8 b0 images]. DTI scans were repeated twice with opposite phase-encoding directions [anterior-to-posterior (AP) and posterior-to-anterior (PA)] to correct eddy-current and susceptibility induced image distortion (see Structural Connectivity). Subsequently, high-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired in the sagittal plane using an inversion-recovery spoiled gradient recalled acquisition (IR-SPGR) sequence [TR = 1.8 s; TE = 2. 67 ms; inversion time = 0.9 s; flip angle 9°; imaging matrix = 256×256; 192 slices; voxel size = 1×1×1 mm3]. All scans were visually checked to ensure acceptable MRI quality.
Anatomical Parcellation.
Preprocessing of T1-weighted MRI was performed using Freesurfer (http://freesurfer.net). The cortical regions were parcellated into anatomically distinct 68 cortical and 14 subcortical regions using Desikan-Killiany atlas, and automatically subdivided into a set of 1014 smaller regions, each of which was a network node (Figure S1A) using Connectome Mapper. This approach resulted in approximately identical node sizes across both hemispheres [mean ± SD = 0.68 ± 0.3 cm3].
DTI Preprocessing.
DTI distortion correction was performed using the FSL toolbox (http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki). Susceptibility-induced off-resonance field was estimated using two acquisitions with opposing polarities of the phase-encode blips (i.e., AP and PA directions) by TOPUP. Correction for the susceptibility, eddy current, and movement-related image distortions were performed using EDDY. No significant difference between groups for head movements was found (mean ± SD in mm; CB: 1.0 ± 0.4; HC: 0.9 ± 0.1; t = 1.15, p = 0.25). A diffusion tensor was fitted at each voxel using nonlinear iterative method to avoid negative eigenvalues, and its directional uncertainty was computed using a 100-times jackknife resampling algorithm. Fiber tracts from the seeded white matter regions were generated using the probabilistic algorithm with voxel-wise directional uncertainty [fractional anisotropy (FA) > 0.1; direction change < 60°; tract length > 1 cm; 30 seeds per voxel; 1,000 Monte-Carlo iterations, generating 30,000 trials at each voxel]. Consistent with previous investigations, structural connectivity (SC) between any pair of nodes was defined as a normalized weight computed by the number of streamlines between interconnected regions (Figure S1B).
Resting-State fMRI Preprocessing.
Resting-state fMRI was preprocessed similar to standard functional connectivity preprocessing using AFNI (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov); de-spiking, slice timing correction, motion correction, normalization to a Talairach template, within-run intensity normalization to a whole-brain mode value of 1000, removal of nuisance time series [6 motions, white matter and ventricular signals (eroded by one voxel), with their derivatives] using linear regression, temporal band-pass filtering (0.009–0.08 Hz), spatial smoothing only in the gray matter mask (6-mm full width at half maximum). A whole brain signal was not included in nuisance covariates given on-going controversy regarding its value. Volumes with high motion were censored to decrease potential motion-induced bias of functional connectivity. We used thresholds with a frame-wise displacement (FD) of 0.5 and a percentage of BOLD signal changes over the whole brain of 0.5, above which scans (including 1 backward and 2 forward volumes) were removed. No significant difference was found in the number of censored volumes from 1,000 resting-state scans between two groups (mean ± SD; CB: 32.2 ± 76.6; HC: 17.2 ± 26.0; t = 0.47, p = 0.64).
Structural and Functional Connectivity.
Consistent with previous investigations, structural connectivity (SC) between any pair of nodes was defined as a normalized weight computed by the number of streamlines between interconnected regions (Figure S1B). Functional connectivity (FC) was estimated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between mean BOLD time-series from all pairs of 1014 brain regions and converted to z-scores using Fisher’s r-to-z transformation (Figure S1B).
Structural-Functional Coupling.
All nonzero elements of the structural connectivity matrix (i.e., the upper triangular part of 1,014×1,014 SC matrix) were extracted and rescaled to a Gaussian distribution (mean ± SD = 0.5 ± 0.1). This rescaling step was motivated by the observation that structural connectivity weights computed from streamline counts often shows a highly skewed (e.g., exponential) distribution, which is unlikely to reflect physiologically meaningful coupling strength; rescaling preserves the rank order of tract weights. Coupling between structural connectivity and its functional counterparts was computed as a Pearson’s correlation coefficient between these two measures. While the structural–functional coupling was decreased in some disease states representing a progress of the disease-related structural–functional impairment, it has also been suggested to be increased in more stringent functional interaction restrained with underlying anatomical connections reflecting both the normal development and the disease.
Distance Dependence of Connectivity Measures.
As described previously, associations between the connection distance (measured by fiber distance between two regions) and connectivity measures were computed, in which distance measures were converted to the log-transformed distance for SC and the inverse of the fiber distance between regions for FC, respectively.
Network Characteristics.
To investigate structural substrates of the SC-FC coupling between two groups, global network properties of the structural connectivity were additionally computed using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet), which collects representative measures for network integration [characteristic path length (λ) and global efficiency (GE)], segregation [clustering coefficient (γ) and modularity (Q)], and their combination or balance [small-worldness (σ)]. To compute normalized measures [i.e., characteristic path length (λ), global efficiency (GE), clustering coefficient (γ) and small-worldness (σ)], 1000 instances of randomly rewired null model matrices (preserving the connections weights, the number of connections, edges, and degree sequences) were generated.
Rich-club Organization.
To subsequently examine the regional impact of SC-FC coupling, a rich-club (RC) in the structural network was defined as a set of high-degree (i.e., “rich”) nodes which were also densely interconnected, more so than expected based on a random null model. Weighted RC organization was quantified for each individual. After all weights (w) in the SC matrix were ranked (wranked), the weighted RC coefficient (𝜙) was computed as a function of node degree (k: the number of connections at each node) by , in which W>k and E>k mean the sum of weights and the number of connections for >k nodes, respectively. The computed RC coefficient, ϕ(k) , was normalized to the mean RC coefficient from 1,000 random null matrices to test whether the actual density of interconnections significantly exceeded that of the null model. Because the degree distributions of the SC matrices differed across individuals, all node degrees were normalized to allow the comparison of equal-sized networks for CB users and healthy non-users (Figure S1C). From the normalized degree distribution across the subjects, we defined RC regions with the top 10% node degree (> 32) as in the previous studies
Statistical Analysis.
Nonparametric randomized permutation testing (10,000 permutations) was used for group comparisons for global and regional SC-FC coupling, RC coefficient, and network metrics. The associations between SC-FC coupling and network metrics were compared using a two-tailed Fisher’s z-test with false-discovery rate (FDR) corrected p < 0.05. Statistical comparisons between groups include educational length, age, sex, and alcohol use as covariates.
